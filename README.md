This repo consists of a bunch of scripts that I wrote while going through the wonderful
book ["The C Programming Language" by Kernighan &
Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

Mainly this repo serves as my notes, and I intend to comment each program as profusely
as I can so that I have all the important stuff written down... _and version
controlled_!

I mainlined neovim 0.5 as my text editor, along with its built-in LSP and treesitter
capabilities, which means a lot of mistakes were already caught by it. Huge props to the
devs for making jumping into C a palatable process!
